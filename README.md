project-2
=========
My to do list is below. I still have many ideas but I think I am really learning this.
Start with the typekit, then put the fonts in ems using proportion, then set up the flexible grid, then add the media queries, then add the images

Revisions from Project 1 for Project 2
  Edited the writing. Shortened the content. Choose lines to use as “call outs.” Made use of the “more >>” feature
x	Looked at the Typekit fonts and they did not seem superior to the free Google Web fonts. I picked three options that I liked and I decided to go with Ubuntu and Ubuntu Condensed.

Here are the runner up choices:

x	Took the “|” out of my title for accessibility and search engines
	Fixed the margins, made them consistent and off the edge of the page
	Added more space to break-up the big blocks of text 
	Reworked my logo so I could add a drop shadow and a boarder using CSS 
	Brightened up the color scheme
	Reworked new background image so it would load faster
	Deleted code that I commented out from previous iterations
x	Made a new Github repository for project 2
	Created consistent navigation with HOME, ABOUT, RESUME, PORTFOLIO

Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.
