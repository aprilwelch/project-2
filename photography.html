            <h2>Quotes</h2>
          <p>"You don't make a photograph just with a camera. You bring to the act of photography all the pictures you have seen, the books you have read, the music you have heard, the people you have loved." </p>
<h5>Ansel Adams</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"What i like about photographs is that they capture a moment that’s gone forever, impossible to reproduce." </p>
<h5>Karl Lagerfeld</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"For me, photography is not a means by which to create beautiful art, but a unique way of encountering genuine reality" </p>
<h5>Daido Moriyama</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"I want pictures like these. The kind that can capture a moment, make it real, make it last. I need pictures that do more than reflect. I need pictures that are truth." </p>
<h5>Lisa Magnum</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"Taking pictures is savoring life intensely, every hundredth of a second." 
 </p><h5>Marc Riboud</h5>

          <p class="quote">"The camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera." </p>
<h5>Dorothea Lange</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"The fundamental issue is one of emphasis: you are not a photographer because you are interested in photography...The reason is that photography is only a tool, a vehicle, for expressing or transmitting a passion in something else. It is not the end result." </p>
<h5>David Hurn (On Being a Photographer: A Practical Guide)</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"It's not that photography recaptures the world you have been in; more that it creates a new one: photographs are like Post-It Notes reminding us of the deep architectonic forms of space and thought." </p>
<h5>Luke Davies (Isabelle the Navigator)</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"It is a cruel, ironical art, photography. The dragging of captured moments into the future; moments that should have been allowed to be evaporate into the past; should exist only in memories, glimpsed through the fog of events that came after.</p>
<h5>Kate Morton (The House At Riverton)</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"All photographs are memento mori. To take a photograph is to participate in another person’s (or thing’s) mortality, vulnerability, mutability. Precisely by slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographs testify to time’s relentless melt." </p>
<h5>Susan Sontag</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"One day, quite some time ago, I happened on a photograph of Napoleon’s youngest brother, Jerome, taken in 1852. And I realized then, with an amazement I have not been able to lessen since: ‘I am looking at eyes that looked at the Emperor.’ Sometimes I would mention this amazement, but since no one seemed to share it, nor even to understand it (life consists of these little touches of solitude), I forgot about it." </p>
<h5>Roland Barthes (Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography)</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"The Guide says there is an art to flying", said Ford, "or rather a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss." </p>
<h5>Douglas Adams</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"A photographer is like a cod, which produces a million eggs in order that one may reach maturity." </p>
<h5>George Bernard Shaw</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"A portrait is not a likeness. The moment an emotion or fact is transformed into a photograph it is no longer a fact but an opinion. There is no such thing as inaccuracy in a photograph. All photographs are accurate. None of them is the truth. " </p>
<h5>Richard Avedon</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"Is a picture really worth a thousand words? What thousand words? A thousand words from a lunatic, or a thousand words from Nietzsche? Actually, Nietzsche was a lunatic, but you see my point. What about a thousand words from a rambler vs. 500 words from Mark Twain? He could say the same thing quicker and with more force than almost any other writer. One thousand words from Ginsberg are not even worth one from Wilde. It’s wild to declare the equivalency of any picture with any army of 1,000 words. Words from a writer like Wordsworth make you appreciate what words are worth.  " </p>
<h5>Jarod Kintz </h5> 

          <p class="quote">"To consult the rules of composition before making a picture is a little like consulting the law of gravitation before going for a walk." </p>
<h5>Edward Weston</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"You can look at a picture for a week and never think of it again. You can also look at a picture for a second and think of it all your life." </p>
<h5>Joan Miró</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"A photograph can be an instant of life captured for eternity that will never cease looking back at you." </p>
<h5>Brigitte Bardot</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"It is through living that we discover ourselves, at the same time as we discover the world around us." </p>
<h5>Henri Cartier-Bresson (Henri Cartier-Bresson: The Modern Century)</h5> 


          <p class="quote">"What's really important is to simplify. The work of most photographers would be improved immensely if they could do one thing: get rid of the extraneous. If you strive for simplicity, you are more likely to reach the viewer. " </p>
<h5>William Albert Allard</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"What the Photograph reproduces to infinity has occurred only once: the Photograph mechanically repeats what could never be repeated existentially." </p>
<h5>Roland Barthes (Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography)</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"For me, the strength of photography lies in its ability to evoke humanity. If war is an attempt to negate humanity, then photography can be perceived as the opposite of war." </p>
<h5>James Nachtwey</h5> 
          
          
          <p class="quote">"No matter how much crap you gotta plow through to stay alive as a photographer, no matter how many bad assignments, bad days, bad clients, snotty subjects, obnoxious handlers, wigged-out art directors, technical disasters, failures of the mind, body, and will, all the shouldas, couldas, and wouldas that befuddle our brains and creep into our dreams, always remember to make room to shoot what you love. It’s the only way to keep your heart beating as a photographer." </p>
<h5>Joe McNally (The Moment It Clicks: Photography Secrets from One of the World's Top Shooters)</h5>

         <p class="quote"> "Photography is without mercy--though it's nonsense to say it does not lie. Rather, it lies in a particular, capricious way which makes beggars of ministers and gods of cat's meat men." </p>
<h5>Nick Harkaway (Angelmaker)</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"The story is told of Michelangelo being asked about his methods for sculpting.
He replied simply that he worked on a block of marble, removing all that was not
part of the sculpture until only the sculpture remained. I suspect this oversimplifies
the art of sculpture, but it’s an excellent analogy for photography, which is
essentially an art of exclusion." </p>
<h5>David duChemin</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"Through photography and image I have been afforded the privilege of sharing the stories and myths of people's lives with others. The process for me became self-revelatory. It was a process of soul-making, something all humans are engaged in, no matter their endeavor. I saw a part of myself in each person I photographed. I came to realize, through the alchemical process of living, that each life is important, no matter how little that life seems to offer." </p>
<h5> J. Don Cook (Shooting from the Hip: Photographs and Essays)</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"What i Like about Photography is that it takes moments that should have been forgotten, and just Freezes them, and allows us to share it with everyone and share it with future generations. But theirs is also the sense of Secrets of the picture, or the stuff you don’t know, or don’t see. You don’t really know what happened before or after a picture its like time is just frozen in that moment."  </p>
<h5>Jesús Holguin</h5>

          <p class="quote">"If the photographer isn't going to pay attention to the picture he is making, that if he thinks the camera is just a machine and not an avenue of expression, then he has no business asking anyone for anything, let alone their time and interest. Don't show the world, he said, invent the world." </p>
<h5>Whitney Otto (Eight Girls Taking Pictures: A Novel)</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"Judging by the photograph it seemed like I hadn’t been there at all. As if it was my camera that had been on holiday, and not me." </p>
<h5>Ida Løkås (Det fine som flyter forbi)</h5> 

          <p class="quote">"Anyone can take a picture of poverty; it’s easy to focus on the dirt and hurt of the poor. It’s much harder—and much more needful—to pry under that dirt and reveal the beauty and dignity of people that, but for their birth into a place and circumstance different from our own, are just like ourselves. I want my images to tell the story of those people and to move us beyond pity to justice and mercy." </p>
<h5>David duChemin (Within the Frame: The Journey of Photographic Vision)</h5> 

<p class="quote">"Photography wasn’t even considered part of the art world until fairly recently. I find it ironic that some people in the world of fine-art photography consider digital photography as somehow “less artistic,” when it is merely a change in process, not vision. The debates will always be there, but your vision is yours alone." </p>
<h5>Richard Olsenius (National Geographic Photography Field Guide: Digital Black and White) </h5>
  
          
<p class="quote">"In this fleeting life, there is nothing stronger than a visual idea or moment stopped in time forever. And nothing does this better than a black-and-white photograph." </p>
<h5>Richard Olsenius (National Geographic Photography Field Guide: Digital Black and White) </h5>

<p class="quote">"The Winter Photograph was my Ariadne, not because it would help me discover a secret thing (monster or treasure), but because it would tell me what constituted that thread which drew me toward Photography. I had understood that henceforth I must interrogate the evidence of Photography, not from the viewpoint of pleasure, but in relation to what we romantically call love and death." </p>
<h5>Roland Barthes (Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography) </h5> 

<p class="quote">"When shooting a story about someone, their hands should always be on your list to shoot."  </p>
<h5>Joe McNally (The Moment It Clicks: Photography Secrets from One of the World's Top Shooters) </h5>

<p class="quote">"Photography is simultaneously and instantaneously the recognition of a fact and the rigorous organization of visually perceived forms that express and signify that fact." </p>
<h5>Henri Cartier-Bresson </h5> 

<p class="quote">"One who argues that photography is not art, only looks at the photograph, they do not look into its meaning." </p>
<h5>Katie Goodnough </h5> 


<p class="quote">"I used to think that I could never lose anyone if I photographed them enough. In fact, my pictures show me how much I’ve lost." </p>
<h5>Nan Goldin </h5> 

<p class="quote">"The sucess of your people pictures depends not so much on your mastery of f/stops and shutter speeds, as on the grace and wit with which you handle this intimate interaction with you subject." </p>
<h5>Jeff Wignall (The Joy of Digital Photography) </h5> 

<p class="quote">"A picture is worth a thousand words, but is 400% less valuable, because a picture only captures one of the senses—sight. However, words can describe the other four senses, making writing four times more potent than photography. " </p>
<h5>Jarod Kintz </h5>
