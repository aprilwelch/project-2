          <h2>Portfolio - Kung Fu</h2> 
          <p>Like many Chicagoans my first introduction to Kung Fu was WGN’s Samurai Sunday, there were rarely any Samurai. There were, however, endless hours of amazing Kung Fu artists. I really liked the old movies where they had one static camera in the distance so you could see full movements and complete motions. No quick cuts, no heavy editing, no special effects just real guys showing off years of practice. Then I saw a Bruce Lee movie as a girl and I was hooked. My mom was in the Marine Corps reserve stationed at the 2/24 headquarters and she talked Sargent Major Wilburn into letting me join his Karate for Women class even though I was 10 years old. This was perfect timing as I still had the fearlessness of youth and I found that I was able to do everything the women did. My attention shifted to field hockey during my high school years but when I went to college I choose Kung Fu. </p>

          <p>Master Bow Sim Mark taught at Boston University, and I would go to her school in Chinatown on the weekends. http://www.taichiarts.com/ Sifu is an amazing person. She is the perfect combination of grace, beauty and power. I am forever grateful for the time I was able to study with her. During those years, I also took Long Fist from Sifu Rick Wong. <a href="http://www.rickwongsmartialarts.com/SifuRickWong.html/">http://www.rickwongsmartialarts.com/SifuRickWong.html</a>. He was very dedicated and he spent extra time beyond our sessions helping those of us in his class who stayed late every session. After college I did some traveling before coming back home to Chicago. </p>
          
          <p> I tried different schools here in Chicago but nothing felt right, in part because Master Mark was so incredible. I decided to learn another style all together. I was working at DePaul when I found the right fit, on that instantly felt right. First I met Sifu Ed de la Cruz and then Sifu Ken Weingart and then Sifu Mountain Ed. They were teaching Wing Chun in our sports center at work after the classes ended I wanted more. I’ve never looked for another school, I found my home with Windy City. <a href="http://windycitywingchun.com/">http://windycitywingchun.com/</a> The foundational material the three Sifu's were sharing came from the incredible Sifu Augustine Fong. Over the years I have had the great pleasure of traveling to Tucson, AZ to learn from him as well. He is a visionary and he has openly shared his talents, experience and skill. He only asks that students use his methods with a good heart and be sincere in all they do. <a href="http://www.fongswingchun.com/">http://www.fongswingchun.com/</a></p>
          
          <!--<p>Bruce Lee said “To me, ultimately, martial arts means honestly expressing yourself. Now, it is very difficult to do. It has always been very easy for me to put on a show and be cocky, and be flooded with a cocky feeling and feel pretty cool and all that. I can make all kinds of phony things. Blinded by it. Or I can show some really fancy movement. But to experience oneself honestly, not lying to oneself, and to express myself honestly, now that is very hard to do.” To me Bruce Lee got it right, I would add that there is a personal journey of exploration that is physical, mental and ethereal. </p> -->

            <p>Sifu Augustine Fong spent year learning from Master Ho Kam Ming who spent years learning the complete Wing Chun System from Grand Master Yip Man.  <a href="http://www.tempewingchun.com/teaching.html/">http://www.tempewingchun.com/teaching.html</a></p>
            
            <img class="photo" src="/kung fu2.jpg" alt="Sifu Fon Semina in Tucson" />
            <p> If you are interested in Wing Chun I would highly recommend you consider taking a trip to Tucson, AZ. Sifu Fong openly invites people from all disciplines to come study with him.
            
             <img class="photo" src="/kung fu4.jpg" alt="Sifu Fon Semina in Tucson" />
            <p>The trips to Tucson are always rich and rewarding experiences. Like everything in life you get out of it what you put into it. Sifu Fong answers question in exactly the way you would expect a Kung Fu master to.</p>
              
             <img class="photo" src="/kung fu7.jpg" alt="Ken, Ed, April and Sifu Fong" />
            <p> Windy City Wing Chun has been a wonderful part of my life. Like-minded people tend to gravitate to each other. Over the years of being together we find that Kung Fu is not the only thing we have in common.</p>
            
             <img class="photo" src="/kung fu8.jpg" alt="Ken, Ed, April" />
            <p> Sifu Ed and Sifu Ken have been like brothers to me over the years. I am very grateful to have rendezvoused with them. I am looking forward to many more years together. <a href="http://www.windycitywingchun.com/">Check out www.windycitywingchun.com</a></p>

          <p>  My time with Master Mark was my favorite part of my college years. I spent as much time with her as I possibly could. This video however does not reflect that. I was so honored that she chose me to be at her side with her daughter for this special. I was also super nervous when the lights came on and the cameras started rolling. I was stumbling on moves I had done flawlessly in class hundreds of times! I felt like I totally let her down in the first video. She comforted me and I got better in the later sessions.</p> <p><a href="http://http://www.taichiarts.com/">Check out the site.</a></p>

          <p>I learned a fan form for a performance once but I had never seen the form executed in the way this team did at the Lenovo pavilion outside the Bird’s Nest during the Olympics in Beijing. They were all young men in the prime of their lives performing with an intensity and precision that was just awesome to watch. </p>

          <p>This is another team doing one of the forms they taught us in Boston. The music they are using was very popular for competitions at the time and the team does a great job staying in sync with each other.</p>

          <p>When I was in China I took a train and a bus and a buggy to get to the original Shaolin temple. Kung Fu Panda came to mind when I saw all the stairs. There is actually a real rope bridge too! I took this video outside the temple, I was not allowed behind the wall. My “but they are so cute” reason for being there was not enough to grant me passage.</p>

           <p>According to http://www.travelchinaguide.com "The Shaolin Temple, located on the Shaoshi Mountain in the west of Dengfeng County, Henan Province, is the 'ancestor court' of Chinese Zen Buddhism. During the Southern and Northern Dynasties (386-589), the Indian monk Bodhidharma, a profound exponent of Zen Buddhism came to China. Emperor Xiaowendi of Northern Wei gave him a very courteous reception. Later, in 496, the emperor decreed that a Buddhist temple be built on the Shaoshi Mountain and food be supplied to the monks. It is today's Shaolin Temple." </p>

          <p class="quote">“I think that what we're seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances within our own innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.” </p><h5>Joseph Campbell</h5>
          
          <p class="quote"> “Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat.”</p><h5>Sun Tzu</h5> 
          
          <p class="quote">“Let the spirit out - Discard all thoughts of reward, all hopes of praise and fears of blame, all awareness of one's bodily self. And, finally closing the avenues of sense perception, let the spirit out, as it will.” </p><h5>Bruce Lee</h5>

          <p class="quote">“I am learning to understand rather than immediately judge or to be judged. I cannot blindly follow the crowd and accept their approach. I will not allow myself to indulge in the usual manipulating game of role creation. Fortunately for me, my self-knowledge has transcended that and I have come to understand that life is best to be lived and not to be conceptualized. I am happy because I am growing daily and I am honestly not knowing where the limit lies. To be certain, every day there can be a revelation or a new discovery. I treasure the memory of the past misfortunes. It has added more to my bank of fortitude.” </p><h5>Bruce Lee</h5> 

           <p class="quote">“The way to find out about happiness is to keep your mind on those moments when you feel most happy, when you are really happy — not excited, not just thrilled, but deeply happy. This requires a little bit of self-analysis. What is it that makes you happy? Stay with it, no matter what people tell you. This is what is called following your bliss.”</p><h5>Joseph Campbell</h5>
