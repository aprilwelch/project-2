      <li> <h2>Portfolio</h2> Throughout my life I have often had the priviledge to write, design and deliver training programs. Below is a selection of programs that I am very proud of. As with everything worthwhile there are many people that contribute to the success of these programs.</li>
      <li> <h3>2013 Exelon Summer Institute</h3> Now in its 6th year, the Exelon Summer Institute is a recognized model for supporting students transitioning to college life. The program is built around the concept of creating a community of learners in the areas of math, physics, chemistry, writing and computer skills. Student teaching teams interact with new students while faculty members conduct specialized lectures and participate in field trips. It is a hands-on program that includes a rocket project, robot wars, and bridge and catapult challenges. In addition, there are mini-projects dispersed throughout the day that give our students an opportunity to flex their intellect with ingenuity and creativity.

The transition to university life and the academic rigors of the first year of college can be challenging. The Exelon Summer Institute is an intensive 4-week program designed to give new students an opportunity to meet current students, make friends and experience college life at IIT. Incoming first year students also benefit from meeting faculty and doing college-level class work in preparation for the fall semester. Additionally during the program new students learn about the city and all the resources available on campus.

      <li> <h3>Academy for Future Leaders in Science and Technology</h3> 1The Academy for Future Leaders in Science and Technology is a 6-week science and technology education and internship program geared toward women and minorities from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The mission of the academy is to achieve greater workforce diversity in the professional fields especially those of environmental science and management by providing opportunities aimed at enriching the academic, social and professional competencies of students who are typically under-represented in higher education science and technology fields.

The goals of the Academy are to create a framework of success that builds a foundation for the student's lifelong achievement by: 1) Increasing access to Environmental Science and Management education; 2) Providing the mentoring support necessary to motivate students to complete their high school education and continue on with post-secondary education, especially in the areas of science, technology and Environmental Science and Management; and 3) Developing awareness of "real world" opportunities in science, technology, and Environmental Science and Management through exposure to existing and emerging careers in this field.
