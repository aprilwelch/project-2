        <li><h2>About</h2></li>
        <li>I have been very fortunate in life. My work is fun and my fun is meaningful. All aspects of my life tend to ebb and flow together in harmony. Currently I am the Director of Business and Educational planning for the Idea Shop at the Illinois Institute of Technology. I am committed to providing an open and flexible learning environment, in which technology seamlessly supports the creative process. The Idea Shop is a configurable collaborative learning space designed to facilitate teamwork and innovation. It is equipped with a 3D rapid prototyping lab, digital media center, iPad library and wall-to-wall IdeaPaint. The Idea Shop is the ideal space for bringing thoughts to reality through idea generation, design thinking, and iterative processing.</li>
        
        <li> Additionally, it is my priviledge to serve as the Program Director for the Exelon Summer Institute at IIT. The Exelon Summer Institute is designed to create a diverse and supportive learning community for first-year college students. This endowed program provides specific strategies for college success, mentorship, and one-on-one tutoring supporting students throughout the academic year. For the past two years I have also organized the Academy for Future Leaders in Science and Technology. This program was made possible by a grant from Toyota.</li>
        
        <li>A brief history... I recieved my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in marketing and communication from Boston University’s School of Management. I was fortunate to land a job in my field right out of college. I worked as part of the worldwide marketing team at Arthur Andersen‘s headquarters in Chicago. Later, I was part of the Educational Technology team at Andersen Consulting (now Accenture). While working full-time I earned my Bachelor of Art in Fine Arts (Photography and Graphic Design) from Loyola University, Chicago. My career then led me to DePaul University where I designed and delivered the Accelerated e-business training program for at risk students and helped with the training component of a PeopleSoft implementation. While at DePaul I earned my Master of Art in Applied Professional Studies with a focus on Instructional Design. My desire to continue writing new training programs for youth led me to the Illinois Institute of Technology. While here I earned my Master of Science in Technical Communication and Information Design. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at IIT pursuing a culminating degree in Technical Communications.</li>
