          <h2>Home</h2> <p>Welcome! Thank you for visiting my website. Here you will find out a little more about me, my interests, my work and my school. I believe that life is about constant expansion. Life should just flow and feel right. Follow your impulses and be a witness to the unfolding of your life. Be brave and expect the best to come to you in any and every moment. You really can be the person you dream you can be. You can do all the things that you want to do. Be fearless enough to selfishly stay true to your dreams as each and everyone of them comes true! The journey is not the reward the real reward is how you feel along the way and that, is your choice not matter what your circumstance. Amazing things, and wonderful experiences are always there for you in your now and in your future. Many people go astray becasue they decide they are going to wait until all their ducks are in a row before they decide its okay to be happy. I suggest you decide to be happy at the first fleeting glimpse of a single duck feather, then just trust that the ducks will show up and line up in their own time. I always say trust the timing of the universe. </p>

            <p> This is in the Australian outback at the Leconfield ranch. I learned how to sheer sheep, rope cattle, and ride off into the sunset from an Aussie horse whisperer named Tim. <a href="http://www.leconfield.com/">Check out Tim's site.</a></p>

          <p class="quote1">“Work like you don't need the money, Love like you've never been hurt, Dance like nobody's watching, Sing like nobody's listening, Live like it's heaven on earth.” 
              </p><h5>William W. Purkey</h5> 
          
         <p class="quote"> "You have brains in your head. You have feet in your shoes. You can steer yourself any direction you choose. You're on your own. And you know what you know. And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go..." </p>
<h5>Dr. Seuss (Oh, the Places You'll Go!)</h5> 
          
          <p class="quote"> "Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that."</p>   <h5>Martin Luther King Jr.</h5> 
          
          <p class="quote"> "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." </p>
<h5>Thomas A. Edison</h5> 
          
          <p class="quote"> There comes a time, in every man's life
When he get's tired of foolin' around
Juggling hearts in a three ring circus
Someday will drive a body down to the ground
I never imagined that love would rain on me
And make me want to settle down
Baby it's true, I think I do
And I just wanna tell you that I wanna with you...
</p><h5>Prince</h5>
